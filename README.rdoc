=Phidgets-FFI

This is a set of FFI bindings for the Phidgets21 library. Like every library, it only
supports the devices that I needed it to but it supports them completely. There is a
manager instance that lists attached devices, callbacks function perfectly, and there
are a set of idiomatic bindings that take the FFI and make it more accessible. Raw FFI
examples are in examples/ffi and the idiomatic versions are in examples/.

==Quick Start

To access the manager and see your attached devices:

  Phidgets::Manager.new do |manager|
    puts manager.devices.inspect
  end
  
  [{
    :type=>"PhidgetServo",
    :label=>"",
    :device_id=>:servo_1motor,
    :serial_number=>12345,
    :name=>"Phidget Servo Controller 1-motor",
    :device_class=>:servo,
    :version=>313
  }]

To access that servo controller and do something with the servo:

  Phidgets::ServoController.new(12345) do |controller|
    servo = controller.servos[0]

    controller.on_change do |servo, position, data|
      print "Moving servo #{servo.index} to #{position}\n"
    end
  
    max = servo.max
    10.times do
      servo.position = rand(max)
      sleep 1
    end
    servo.engaged = false
  end

==Logging

Logging can be accomplished by either accessing the C library directly or using the idiomatic method.
There are additional examples of each in the examples/ directory.

  Phidgets::Log.enable(:verbose, nil)
  Phidgets::Log.info('identifier', 'message')
  Phidgets::Log.error('identifier', 'message')
  Phidgets::Log.disable

==Notes

Again, note that not every device is here. I'm more than happy to add support for it
but I'll need a test device to make sure it works ;)

PS. I'm serious, contact me if you want my mailing address.
